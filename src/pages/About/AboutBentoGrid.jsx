        <p className="p-2">
          My fascination with technology started as a child, watching how people
          used it to make life easier. As I grew, this interest deepened, and I
          became curious about creating solutions myself. I saw how developers
          built real-world applications to solve problems, which inspired me to
          start learning web development. I began with HTML and CSS through
          YouTube tutorials, and later joined a bootcamp called Evangadi, where
          I became a full-stack web developer.
